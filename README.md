# 🌟 Exciting Milestone Achieved! 🌟

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve successfully completed the **Mobile Development Using Flutter** course from the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**, covering 162 hours of intensive learning in:

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Flutter Development
- Dart
- Git
- Freelancing

💡 **As part of the course, I developed a full-featured E-commerce app for shoes.** Some key features of the app include:

- **Product Catalog**: Browse a wide range of shoes with detailed descriptions and images.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily find products based on keywords or categories.
- **Cart Management**: Add, update, or remove items in the cart.
- **Order Confirmation**: A smooth checkout experience with order confirmation and success messages.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup using Firebase Authentication.
- **Wishlist**: Save your favorite items for future purchases.

For state management, I utilized **BLoC with Cubit** and implemented the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture for better separation of concerns. For networking, I integrated **Dio** for seamless API calls, and I used **Postman** for thorough API testing. To handle failures gracefully, I implemented **Either** for robust error management.

You can explore the various packages I used in this project on my GitHub:

A huge thank you to my instructors **Mohamed Alfalaky** and **Shaimaa Fakhraldin** for their guidance and dedication during the course! 🙏

This experience has strengthened both my Flutter and freelancing skills, and I’m eager to take on new projects and collaborations. 🚀

Looking forward to what’s next! 💼
